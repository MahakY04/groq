Here is a Jenkinsfile for a Node.js project using the NodeJs_18 agent label:
```
pipeline {
    agent {
        label 'NodeJs_18'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://your-git-repo-url.com/your-repo-name.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // No deployment command provided, so do nothing
                echo 'No deployment command provided.'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Let me explain what each section does:

* `pipeline`: This is the top-level declaration for the pipeline.
* `agent`: This specifies the agent label, which determines the environment in which the pipeline will run. In this case, we're using a Node.js 18 agent.
* `stages`: This defines the stages of the pipeline.
* `stage('Checkout')`: This stage checks out the code from the specified Git repository.
* `stage('Build')`: This stage runs `npm install` to build the project.
* `stage('Test')`: This stage runs `npm test` to execute the project's tests.
* `stage('Deploy')`: This stage would typically deploy the project, but since no deployment command was provided, it simply echoes a message indicating that no deployment will occur.

Note that you'll need to replace `https://your-git-repo-url.com/your-repo-name.git` with the actual URL of your Git repository.
